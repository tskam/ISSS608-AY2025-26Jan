    "text": "Words of Encouragement\nFor the next 10 weeks, your learning journey will be very bumpy, especially come to R programming\n\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don’t hesitate to approach me.\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily."

All work (whether oral or written) submitted for purposes of assessment must be the student’s own work. Penalties for violation of the policy range from zero marks for the component assessment to expulsion, depending on the nature of the offense. When in doubt, students should consult the instructors of the course.

A strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and video before coming to class. Students are encouraged to post question or issue encountered while viewing the video or reading the recommended articles on Piazza. Student sharing of insights from readings of assigned materials on Piazza will form a large part of the learning in this course. After learning the data visuaisation concepts and methods from lesson materials, the hands-on exercises aim to provide students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience on using selected R packages. It is important for students to complete the hands-on exercises before class. This is because the in-class discussion will extend the methods learned from the hands-on exercise to advanced modelling.\n\n\nIn-class Exercise and Class Participation\nDuring lesson, students are required to complete a series of in-class exercises using either Tableau or R. The in-class discussion will focus on how to critic existing data visualisation and how to deliver effective visual communication. In general, these exercises are guided interactively. By the end of each lesson, students are required to publish their in-class exercise on Tableau Public or Netlify.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise\nThe take-home exercise provides students with the opportunity to revise and practice the R packages and programming skills they had learned in class at home. It is a weekly exercise. Each exercise is designed to be completed within 3-5 hours. The exercise is not a repetition of the in-class exercise but it requires students to be innovative and creative in applying appropriate R packages to design enlightening and yet functional data visualisation for analytics purposes.\nStudents may work together to help one another with R programming issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\n\n\nVisual Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the project is to provide students first hand experience on building web-enabled visual analytics application by using Shiny. It aims to democratize data and analytics. Hence, the application focuses and emphasises on interactivity and effective integration of techniques from data analytics and data visualization.\nFor more details please refer to Visual Analytics Project page."
